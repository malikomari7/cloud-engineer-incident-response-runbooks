# Cloud Engineer Incident Response & Operating Model

This repository documents a production-ready, security-led incident response operating model designed for hybrid and cloud environments.

It reflects real-world on-call experience, enterprise SOC workflows, and cloud engineering best practices.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate how cloud engineers:
- Respond to production security incidents
- Classify severity based on business and technical impact
- Execute emergency changes safely
- Conduct blameless postmortems to improve systems

This is not theoretical documentation. It is based on real incident response experience in enterprise environments.

## Operating Model Overview

- Security-led incident response
- Cloud engineer acting as primary responder
- 24/7 enterprise SOC alignment
- Retroactive approval for emergency changes
- Blameless postmortem culture

## Repository Structure

- `runbooks/` – Step-by-step incident response procedures
- `severity-matrix/` – Enterprise severity classification framework
- `change-management/` – Emergency change and containment procedures
- `postmortems/` – Blameless postmortem templates

## Intended Audience

- Cloud Engineers
- Security Engineers
- Site Reliability Engineers
- Technical Hiring Managers
